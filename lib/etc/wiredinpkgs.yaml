# packages that GHCJS treats as wired-in
#
# A wired-in package has no version numbers of package key in the
# JavaScript names. Runtime system code can therefore directly
# use the names.
#
# This means that only one instance of a wired-in package can be used.
#
# All packages referred to by thdeps.yaml and rtsdeps.yaml either have to
# be listed here or be already wired-in in GHC. Dependencies of a
# wired-in package do not need to be wired-in themselves.
# Only stage1 packages can be wired-in.
