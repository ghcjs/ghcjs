Haskell to JavaScript compiler
==============================

GHCJS is a Haskell to JavaScript compiler that uses the GHC API.

GHCJS supports many modern Haskell features, including:

 * All type system extensions supported by GHC
 * Lightweight preemptive threading with blackholes, MVar, STM, asynchronous exceptions
 * Weak references, CAF deallocation, StableName, StablePtr
 * Unboxed arrays, emulated pointers
 * Integer support through [JSBN](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/), 32 and 64 bit signed and unsigned arithmetic (`Word64`, `Int32` etc.)
 * Cost-centres, stack traces
 * Cabal support, GHCJS has its own package database

And some JavaScript-specific features:

 * New JavaScriptFFI extension, with convenient import pattens, asynchronous FFI and a JSRef FFI type
 * Synchronous and asynchronous threads

Installation
============

GHCJS can be installed with GHC 7.8.2 or later.

### Requirements

 - GHC 7.8.2 or higher
 - Cabal 1.22 and cabal-install 1.22 or higher
 - alex and happy
 - [node.js](http://nodejs.org) 0.10.28 or higher. GHCJS uses node.js for its build system and for running Template Haskell.

### Platform-specific preparation

#### Linux / OS X

 * A recent version of `alex` and `happy` need to be in your `PATH`
 * `git`, `make`, `cpp`, `autoreconf` need to be in your `PATH`
 * One of the dependencies is the `terminfo` Haskell package, which requires `libtinfo`. On
   Debian/Ubuntu this is provided by the `libtinfo-dev` package.

#### Windows

 * You need a shell that's capable of running autotools scripts (with `git`, `make`, `cpp`, `autoreconf` installed). See the [GHCJS Wiki](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/wiki/Preparing-the-Windows-build-environment) or the `INSTALL.windows` file for instructions for setting up MSYS2 for this.
 * A recent version of `alex` and `happy` need to be in your `PATH`
 * Virus scanners often interfere with configure scripts (permission denied errors),
   disable on-access scanning before running `ghcjs-boot`.

### Installation steps

If you use GHC 7.8, you need to update your `Cabal` to version 1.22 to be able to use
GHCJS. GHC 7.10 already includes a compatible `Cabal` version. Cabal support has been
merged upstream, get the correct version from https://github.com/haskell/cabal or from
Hackage once it has been released.

Note that you need a compatible `Cabal` library in your GHC package database, just upgrading
the `cabal-install` program is not enough. `ghcjs-boot` will complain if it finds an incompatible
version.

Make sure that you're now running the updated `cabal-install`, `GHCJS` support must be listed under the compiler flags:

    $ cabal install --help | grep GHCJS
        --ghcjs                         compile with GHCJS

#### Install GHCJS

Next, install `ghcjs` and its `ghcjs-prim` dependency:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs-prim.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs.git
    $ cabal install ./ghcjs ./ghcjs-prim

If `cabal install ./ghcjs ./ghcjs-prim` fails because cabal cannot resolve dependencies, try adding `--reorder-goals --max-backjumps=-1`. Sometimes the `transformers` package causes problems, since GHC ships with an older version. Try `--constraint=transformers==0.3.0.0` (or the version that came with your GHC) if the problem looks related to this package.

#### Build the libraries

Use `ghcjs-boot` to build the base libraries for `GHCJS`:

    if you used the Git repository to install:
    $ ghcjs-boot --dev

    if you are doing a development build with GHC 7.10, you need to tell `ghcjs-boot` to use the `ghc-7.10` branch of the `ghcjs-boot` repository:
    $ ghcjs-boot --dev --ghcjs-boot-dev-branch ghc-7.10

    if you are using a package from hackage that includes the libraries:
    $ ghcjs-boot

Some distros install node.js as `nodejs` instead of `node`. Add `--with-node nodejs` to the `ghcjs-boot` command in that case.

Usage
=====

`ghcjs` can be invoked with the same command line arguments as `ghc`. The generated programs can be run directly from
the shell with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [SpiderMonkey jsshell](http://download.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/).
for example:

    $ ghcjs -o helloWorld helloWorld.hs
    $ node helloWorld.jsexe/all.js
    Hello world!

### Cabal support

Use `cabal install --ghcjs packageName` to install a package

Most packages from hackage should work out of the box. The main exception is packages with foreign (non-Haskell) dependencies.
For these packages a JavaScript implementation of the dependencies must be provided. If a package you want to use does
not work, please create a ticket.

### Sandboxes

You can use Cabal sandboxes with GHCJS, create a new sandbox with:

    $ cabal sandbox init

Then you can just configure with `--ghcjs` to build with GHCJS inside the sandbox:

    $ cabal install --ghcjs

If you also want to set GHCJS as the default compiler in the sandbox, run:

    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ echo "compiler: ghcjs" >> cabal.config

Setting the default compiler to `ghcjs` makes `cabal sandbox exec` and `cabal sandbox hc-pkg` use
GHCJS-specific settings. These commands do not know about the configure flags, so setting the default
compiler is the only way to make them use the correct settings for GHCJS.

### Package databases

Use `ghcjs-pkg` to manipulate the GHCJS package database

The package database and runtime files from the [shims](https://github.com/ghcjs/shims.git) repository are kept in the
GHCJS application data directory, typically `~/.ghcjs/`. Remove this directory to reset your GHCJS installation, you
will need to run `ghcjs-boot --init` again.

See [GHCJS introduction](http://weblog.luite.com/wordpress/?p=14) for more examples.

Hacking GHCJS
=============

If you want to hack on GHCJS, please join our friendly community on IRC at `#ghcjs` on freenode (You're also
welcome if you only use the compiler or just want to chat about it!). Read the [HACKING.markdown](HACKING.markdown) document
to get started. The [wiki](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs/wiki) may also contain useful information.

JSC and webkit
==============

Applications that use the following libraries should compile with GHCJS
and run in a modern web browser and interface with DOM and JavaScript
in the browser.
 * [webkit](https://patch-tag.com/r/hamish/webkit) - Bindings for WebKitGTK+ that provide a low level DOM interface.
 * [webkit-javascriptcore](https://github.com/ghcjs/webkit-javascriptcore) - Low level bindings for JavaScriptCore
 * [jsc](https://github.com/ghcjs/jsc) - Higher level interface for JavaScriptCore

You can use these libraries without GHCJS to build a native version of
your application (it will use WebKitGTK+ to run without a browser).
