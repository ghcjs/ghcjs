The plan here is to extract a list of groups of elements of the graph
such that each group has no dependence except on nodes in previous
groups (i.e. in particular they may not depend on nodes in their own
group) and is maximal such group.

Clearly we cannot provide a solution for cyclic graphs.

We proceed by iteratively removing elements with no outgoing edges
and their associated edges from the graph.

This probably isn't very efficient and certainly isn't very clever.
